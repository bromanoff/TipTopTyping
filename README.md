### Thumb-to-finger Text Input for Mobile Augmented Reality Applications


#### About
TipTopTYping is a vision based thumb-to-finger text input system that allows users to input text by performing pinch gestures between the thumb and the four fingers of each hand. With TipTopTyping, the 26 letters of the english alphabet are grouped into six letter-groups and mapped onto index- middle- and ring-finger of each hand. The pinky fingers are reserved for space and delete keys. A trie datastructure forms the basis for storing and recognitizing words.
#### Layout
The user can choose in between the QWERTY and OPTI character layout. The OPTI layout is optimized in order to make frequent characters of the english language more accessible and to reduce alternation between hands.
